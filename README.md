# Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default. It involves a complete end-to-end data science workflow — including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

---

## Project Objective

To help financial institutions reduce loan default risk by using classification algorithms that predict if an applicant will default based on demographic and financial features.
